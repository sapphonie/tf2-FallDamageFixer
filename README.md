## Tf2 Fall Damage Fixer

removes randomness in tf2's fall dmg by recalculating fall dmg according to tf2s source code WITHOUT adding the random +/- 20%

uses sdkhooks and sdktools

latest version here: https://github.com/stephanieLGBT/tf2-FallDamageFixer/releases/latest

### Installation:

* extract zip from releases
* drag addons folder into your tf folder thru ftp

### Known bugs:

~~* On plugin reload every player has to rejoin the server for sdktools to rehook them as an entity. This only applies if you manually reload the plugin thru `sm plugins reload tf2FallDmgFix`~~ should be fixed
