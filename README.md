removes randomness in tf2's fall dmg by recalculating fall dmg according to tf2s source code WITHOUT adding the random +/- 20%

uses sdkhooks and sdktools

this is in mega beta and i dont know how laggy or functional it will be. currently 0.0.5 works perfectly but i've only tested it with a single person (me) in a server.

i make no guaruntees about its stability.

Known bugs:

* on plugin reload every player has to rejoin the server for sdktools to rehook them as an entity
